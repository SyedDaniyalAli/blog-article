#Async Concept 
Asynchronous programming is a concept which allows not blocking the program workflow when waiting for the results of certain actions. So you can open a large file or query a database, but your program will continue processing each line afterwards. 
This concept was first needed on the kernel level, because you want to be able to listen to music while you type something on your keyboard. On a software level, this was achieved through multi-threading. On the CPU side, you can have multiple processes running on each core at the same time.
